  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    Look no further for a creamy and ultra smooth classic cheesecake recipe! 
    Paired with a buttery graham cracker crust, no one can deny its simple 
    decadence.
  </p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <h4>For Crust</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 3/4 cups (230 grams) graham crackers crumbs (about 15 whole graham crackers)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter, melted</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>For Filling</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>32 ounces (907 grams) cream cheese, completely softened to room temperature</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups (250 grams) granulated sugar</li>
    <li>2/3 cup (173 grams) sour cream or plain full fat yogurt, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F.</li>
    <li>Prepare a 9-inch springform pan for a water bath. 
      Place a large square of heavy-duty aluminum foil underneath the pan. 
      Gently fold the edges up and around the pan. Repeat twice so there are 
      three sheets of foil, to ensure a waterproof seal. Gently fold the top 
      of the foil around the edge of the pan. Spray with nonstick cooking spray.
    </li>
    <h4>Make the Crust:</h4>
    <li>In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and butter 
      until the mixture is moistened. Press firmly into the bottom and halfway 
      up the sides of the prepared pan. Place gently on oven rack and bake for 
      10 minutes. Place gently on a wire rack to cool. Maintain oven temperature.
    </li>


    <h4>Make the Filling:</h4>
    <li>In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the cream cheese on 
      medium speed until completely smooth and free of lumps, scraping down 
      the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Add the sugar and beat until 
      combined. Add in the sour cream, lemon zest, and juice and beat until 
      combined, continuing to scrape down the bowl. Add the eggs, one at a time, 
      and beat until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
    </li>

    <li>Pour the batter into the foiled-wrapped springform pan. Tap the pan 
      against the counter a few times to release any air bubbles in the batter. 
      The cheesecake won’t rise much while baking in the water bath, so it’s okay
       if the batter fills up most of the springform pan.
    </li>


    <li>Place the springform pan in a larger roasting pan or deep sauté pan. 
      Place on oven rack then carefully pour boiling water into the roasting pan
       until the water is about halfway up the sides of the cheesecake pan. Bake 
       at 325°F for about 1 hour and 15 minutes or until the top looks slightly 
       dry, especially at the edges. If the middle is slightly wobbly like jello,
        that’s fine. The internal temperature should read 150°F with an 
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center. Err on the side of 
        underbaking rather than overbaking.
    </li>

    <li>Turn off the oven heat and open the oven door open just by 1-inch. 
      I use a wooden spoon to keep it open. Let the cheesecake cool inside 
      the oven for 30 minutes to 1 hour. This will prevent cracks from forming.
    </li>

    <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and from the water bath, unwrap 
      the foil, and transfer it to a cooling rack. Run a thin-bladed flexible
        knife around the edge of the cheesecake, to make sure it's not sticking 
        to the sides (which can cause cracks as it cools). Let the cheesecake 
        cool completely to room temperature on the rack.
    </li>

    <li>Once completely cooled, refrigerate in the springform pan until 
      completely chilled, at least 5 hours or up to 3 days. Store the cheesecake 
      uncovered to avoid creating condensation, which will create a mushy texture.
    </li>
  </ol>
